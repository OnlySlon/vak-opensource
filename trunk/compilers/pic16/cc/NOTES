1) Functions may have not more that two arguments.
   The total size of arguments cannot exceed 4 bytes.

2) Size of long is 4 bytes, short - 2 bytes,
   char and int - 1 byte.  The simple pointer has the size of 1 byte,
   far pointer - 2 bytes.

3) The type of pointer to pointer is equivalent to (char*) for simple
   pointers, and (short*) for far pointers.

4) All functions must be declared before use. The argument lists
   in function declarations are not supported.

5) Bit operations are supported, for example:

	if (a.1)
		b.4 = 1;

   The only operations for bits are:
   - assignment of zero (a.N = 0);
   - assignment of one (a.N = 1);
   - xor with one (a.N ^= 1);
   - conditional check (if (a.N) or if (! a.N)).

6) Direct placement of data and functions is supported,
   for example:

	short PROD @ 0x18;
	void startup () @ 0
	{ ... }

   The startup() function will be placed in command memory at address 0,
   the variable PROD references the data memory at address 18h.
