JUDO - A Java IDE for Children and Beginning Programmers
JUDO v1.3 Copyright (C) 2001  Thomas J. Dunn

This version of JUDO does not include a Java 2 JDK.  You need
to have a Java 2 JDK before you can use JUDO.  You can
find a JDK to work with JUDO at http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/
After installing the JDK, use the java executable that comes
with the JDK to run JUDO.  Fix one of the included 'run'
scripts (run.sh or run.bat) to point to your JDK java
executable.

JUDO is a program written to help people learn to program,
pure and simple.  It is free software and you are encouraged
to give it to others, look at its source code, or improve it.
It is currently of Beta quality.  There are bugs.

JUDO was developed on the Windows platform, but care was
taken to make it cross-platform.  However, I have not tested
it, or even installed it on other platforms.

I created JUDO while I was teaching a programming class to
12-14 year olds in Boston, MA.  The program I did this with
is called Citizen Schools (http://www.citizenschools.com)
and I recommend that you it out.
