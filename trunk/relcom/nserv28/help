This automatic mail server relays news articles from Relcom and USENET via
usual E-mail.  If you want to use server you should send e-mail letter
containing the list of commands to the address $$.
Subject is ignored.  Command name can be in upper or lower case,
all other arguments are case sensitive.

Here comes brief description of available commands:

HELP                    Send this file.  All subsequent commands are ignored.

LIST                    Give the list of all news groups with
			brief description.

LIST hierarchy          Give the list of news groups from the given hierarchy.
			For example, "list comp.sources".

			from a group will be immediately sent to you.

		    WARNING:
			Never use feed mode if you're not completely sure
			that you need *all* articles and your e-mail
			connection is stable and permanent. This mode can
			easily cause e-mail traffic jams making impossible
			to send or receive any electronic mail at your machine.
			This can result in disconnecting your machine from net
			by some administrator, so be careful.

RFEED size group        Subscribe to group in restricted feed mode.

			will be sent to you as in feed mode.  Lists of bigger
			articles will be sent to you as in notify mode.

UNSUBSCRIBE all         Unsubscribe from all groups.

FORGET                  If you were subscribed to some groups, and later
			unsubscribed, server continues to send you
			lists of newly created or deleted news groups,
			hoping that you might get interested in them.
			To finally unconnect from server give
			command FORGET.

PACK                    Enable packing mode.  All articles sent to you
			will be packed, compressed and encoded.
			This will reduce the volume and the total number
			of transmitted files.  This mode is highly
			recommended.
			You should unpack received batches by one of the
			special utilities UNBATCH, UUNPACK or use mailer
			BML, which decodes batches on the fly.
			You can get the UNBATCH program (with sources)
			for MSDOS by command

			    SEND uunpack-dos

			or for Unix 386

			    SEND unbatch-386

			or for Xenix 286

			    SEND unbatch-286

			If you need only sources of unpack programs
			you can get them by

			    SEND unpack-src
			and
			    SEND unbatch-src

PACK OFF                Disable packing mode.

SEND                    Show list of files available on request.
			You can get these files by command SEND with parameters.

WARNING: don't use user name "uucp" or "news" to receive news -
	 server ignores these names.

In order to submit an article you should send the article with the
header field "Newsgroups:" containing the comma-separated list of
newsgroups (all newsgroups should be valid) to the address $$.

The default distribution of the message is the whole world, so you should
think twice before sending your article. Remember it will be read by
thousands or millions of readers around the world, so your message
should not be offensive, should not violate copyright laws. Never write
things already written by somebody. It's better to restrict distribution
area to be as small as possible. You can do it using
the header field "Distribution:". Valid distributions are:

	world, eunet, su, russia, moscow

Example:
	% mailx $$
	Subject: testing
	~: headline Newsgroups relcom.test
	(continue)
	~: headline Distribution su
	(continue)
		Twas brilling...
	.
	EOT
	%
