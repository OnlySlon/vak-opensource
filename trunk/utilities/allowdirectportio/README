******************************************************************************

allowdirectportio is a program used to allow user space programs to access
I/O directly for Linux programs running on an x86 platform or hardware that
has a similar I/O model.

This program has a _long_ name because it should _only_ be used as a _last_
resort, when a proper solution is not feasible or is impractical.

For usage see 'allowdirectportio --help'.

The executable for allowdirectportio is assumed to be setuid root if it is
to be used by a non root user. Permissions are granted to ports specified in
the C source file. Once permissions are granted, process priveleges are
dropped as the effective user id of the program is set back to those of the
user that invoked it.

To change or add to the specified ports, one must edit the source code. To
change where the program is installed and what it is named, one must edit
the Makefile.

Installation instructions: Read the Makefile and C source code first.
Basically:
   make           # as a non root user
   make install   # as root or using something like sudo
