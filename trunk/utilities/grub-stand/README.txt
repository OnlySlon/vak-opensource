Creating standalone binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is an example of compiling programs, which can be loaded
by GRUB and run standalone on i386 hardware.

This is useful for developing hardware-oriented utilities:
testing, formatting, repairing etc.

The original sources are taken from GRUB documentation
(http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/).
